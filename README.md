# CMS

## Development

Run `npm install` followed by `npm run dev`.

## Project Structure

Astro looks for `{html,astro,md}` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## Deploy

Deployed to https://cms-astro.pages.dev/ via Cloudflare.
